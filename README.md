# Hello Everyone! I‚Äôm Kennedy Maturure, an Aspiring AI/ML Engineer üëã:

üíª **I‚Äôm currently working on**  
Advancing my expertise in AI and machine learning as part of my Master‚Äôs in Computer Science at Drexel University (Expected Graduation: June 2026). I‚Äôm focusing on projects like AI-driven recruiting systems, predictive modeling for health indicators, and computer vision applications for identity verification.

ü§ù **I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on**  
Innovative AI/ML projects, open-source contributions, or research involving deep learning, computer vision, or natural language processing. I‚Äôm eager to work on real-world applications that leverage tools like LangChain, OpenCV, or PyTorch.

üÜò **I‚Äôm looking for help with**  
Scaling AI models for production environments and optimizing large-scale data pipelines for distributed systems.

üìö **I‚Äôm currently learning**  
Advanced topics in computer vision, reinforcement learning, and simulation/modeling to enhance my ability to build robust AI systems.

‚ùì **Ask me about**  
AI-driven solutions (e.g., resume parsing, license verification), machine learning model development (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression), or data preprocessing techniques (e.g., PCA, ETL pipelines).

üéâ **Fun fact**  
I optimized database queries at Mealie Brand Zimbabwe, reducing response time by 35%, and I love tackling challenges‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs fine-tuning an LLM or debugging a complex system!

## üöÄ Featured Projects:

- **AI Agency Recruiter System (Multi-Agent LLM-powered)** *(Winter 2025)*  
  Designed an AI-driven recruiting system using LangChain, OpenAI Swarm, and Ollama for resume parsing, job matching, and skill extraction. Fine-tuned Llama 3.2 with RAG for context-aware recommendations and built an interactive UI with Streamlit for real-time hiring insights.

- **Predicting Diabetes from Health Indicators** *(Fall 2024)*  
  Developed a predictive model using the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset (100k training, 25k validation). Applied PCA for feature selection, trained Logistic Regression and SVM models, and achieved 90% accuracy in identifying diabetes risk factors.

- **AI Driver‚Äôs License Verification** *(Fall 2022)*  
  Built an AI system for local police using OpenCV and TensorFlow for face and license plate detection. Integrated with MySQL for real-time validation, secured data with AES-256 encryption, and conducted field tests for reliability.
